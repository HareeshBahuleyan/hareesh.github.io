<p>I am Hareesh Bahuleyan, currently pursing my graduate studies in the department of Management Sciences at the University of Waterloo, Canada. My research focuses on natural language processing and the applications of machine learning to text data.</p>

<p>Prior to this, I was working as an analyst at Citibank. I am an alumnus of the Indian Institute of Technology Madras, having graduated in 2015 with a dual degree in Civil Engineering. I have always been fascinated by data analytics because it enables in rational decision making based on what the data tells us. With interests in the areas of statistical analysis, data mining, machine learning and text analytics, I wish to share my learning and experiences through this blog.</p>
